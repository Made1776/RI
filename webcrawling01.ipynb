      "Descripción: Bougatsa, a Greek pastry that's delicious for breakfast or anytime, has a creamy but sturdy lemon-vanilla custard baked between layers of crisp and flaky phyllo dough.\n",
      "Ingredientes:\n",
      "- 4 large eggs, at room temperature\n",
      "- 2/3 cup white sugar\n",
      "- 3 cups whole milk\n",
      "- 1/2 cup semolina flour\n",

      "- 3/4 cup unsalted butter, divided\n",
      "- 18 (14x9-inch) frozen phyllo pastry sheets, thawed\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons confectioner's sugar\n",
      "- 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n",
      "Instrucciones:\n",
      "- Crispy and flaky, smooth and filled with a semolina custard—these textures are what make bougatsa so great. There are hints of lemon and vanilla and a sweetness that evens everything out. But what is bougatsa?\n",
      "- Bougatsa is a traditional Greek pastry served often for breakfast or dessert. It’s made by layering sheets of phyllo dough, a thin unleavened dough used in Greek, Balkan, and Middle Eastern cuisine, and filled with a sweet, milky semolina custard.\n",
      "- The recipe also includes eggs, vanilla, sugar, butter, lemon juice and zest as well as powdered sugar and cinnamon as a topping. There really aren’t too many ingredients, which is the beauty of this recipe. There are two main parts to this recipe: preparing the custard, then layering the phyllo dough with the custard. The oven does the rest of the work. Allow the bougatsa to cool slightly before serving. This will help the custard set, and the pastry will cut into slices easier.\n",
      "- “I’ve never had this dish before, and I gotta say, it’s one of the best things I’ve eaten in a while (and I eat a lot),” says recipe tester and developer Liz Mervosh. “It’s just sweet enough to satiate your sweet tooth and also savory from the butter-coated phyllo sweets. Forget your French breakfast pastries, go Greek!”\n",
      "- Here are some tips and tricks from recipe developer Jasmine Smith:\n",
      "- Editorial contributions by Keaton Larson\n",
      "- Gather the ingredients.\n",
      "- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n",
      "- Beat eggs with a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Add white sugar; beat on medium speed until thick and foamy, 4 to 5 minutes.\n",
      "- Meanwhile, heat milk in a large saucepan over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until milk begins to simmer. With mixer on low speed, slowly pour hot milk into egg mixture, beating until fully combined, about 30 seconds.\n",
      "- Return milk mixture to saucepan. Place saucepan over medium-low heat, and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture begins to simmer and thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually whisk in semolina flour; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened to a porridge consistency, 1 to 2 minutes.\n",
      "- Remove saucepan from heat. Gradually whisk cold butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, into mixture in saucepan until emulsified, about 2 minutes. Whisk in lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla. Let custard stand at room temperature while preparing baking pan, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "- Brush bottom and sides of a nonstick 13- x 9-inch baking pan with about 1 tablespoon of the melted butter. Gently unfold and place phyllo sheets on a clean work surface; cover using a damp clean kitchen towel to keep phyllo moist while you work. Layer 8 phyllo sheets in the prepared baking pan, lightly brushing each sheet with melted butter.\n",
      "- Spread custard over phyllo in an even layer. Top with 2 phyllo sheets, lightly brushing each sheet with melted butter and stretching sheets to cover sides of baking pan.\n",
      "- Working with remaining 8 phyllo sheets, 1 sheet at a time, place phyllo sheet on work surface; lightly brush with melted butter. Starting from 1 short end, fold phyllo sheet accordion-style to create a long strip with 2-inch-wide pleats. Place folded phyllo strip crosswise in baking pan with pleats facing up. Repeat brushing and folding process with remaining 7 phyllo sheets and melted butter, placing strips side by side to completely cover baking pan.\n",
      "- Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and crispy, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven, and let bougatsa cool slightly at room temperature for 30 minutes. Dust evenly with confectioner's sugar and cinnamon. Slice into squares, and serve warm or at room temperature.\n",

      "- 1 packet active dry yeast\n",
      "- 1 cup warm water, at 105 degrees F (40 degrees C)\n",
      "- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more as needed\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon white sugar\n",
      "- 3 cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n",
      "- 12 slices fresh plum\n",
      "- 4 slices prosciutto, each slice cut into thirds\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons chopped rosemary (optional)\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste\n",
      "Instrucciones:\n",
      "- Stir yeast and warm water together in a large bowl and let stand for 15 minutes.\n",
      "- Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, sugar, all-purpose flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir until a very soft, sticky dough forms. While stirring, incorporate any dough that sticks to the sides of the bowl.\n",
      "- Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub some on your hands. Pick up dough, and with your fingers under the dough pushing gently up, stretch the sides down and under several times while rotating the dough, in order to form a relatively smooth ball with some surface tension on top. Place dough ball into the bowl, smooth side up, cover the bowl, and refrigerate overnight.\n",
      "- The next morning, pull out dough and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.\n",
      "- Generously oil a work surface with about 1 tablespoon olive oil, and transfer dough to the work surface. Press into a large rectangle, and then fold into thirds one way, and then the other, forming a small rectangle, about 6x9 inches.\n",
      "- Generously oil a sheet pan with about 2 tablespoons olive oil, and transfer dough rectangle to the sheet pan. Press dough out to about 1/2-inch thick. Cover; let proof at room temperature until dough has spread out, risen slightly, and surface has bubbles, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\n",
      "- Meanwhile, wrap plum sections with prosciutto and refrigerate until needed.\n",
      "- Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).\n",
      "- Sprinkle dough with rosemary. Push wrapped plum sections deep into the dough in a 3x4 pattern. Drizzle top lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with sea salt.\n",
      "- Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 17 to 20 minutes. As soon as focaccia is out of the oven, brush with more olive oil if desired. Transfer focaccia to a rack and let cool completely  before cutting.\n",

      "Título: Jalapeno Popper Potato Salad\n",
      "Descripción: This jalapeno popper potato salad has the heat, the salty bacon, the cheese, and the creamy ranch-seasoned dressing that put jalapeno poppers top of mind. Bacon and potatoes roast at the same time, making prep easier.\n",
      "Ingredientes:\n",
      "- 10 slices bacon\n",
      "- 3 pounds red potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",
      "- 1 (1 ounce) packet ranch seasoning mix, divided\n",
      "- 1 teaspoons kosher salt\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n",
      "- 4 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish if desired\n",
      "- 2 jalapenos, seeded and finely chopped, plus more for garnish\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons chopped pickled jalapenos, plus 1 tablespoon juice from jar\n",
      "- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese\n",
      "- 8 ounces sour cream\n",
      "- 1/3 cup mayonnaise\n",
      "Instrucciones:\n",
      "- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with foil or parchment. Arrange bacon in a single layer on a prepared pan. Add potatoes to the second pan and toss with oil, 2 tablespoons ranch seasoning, salt, and pepper until well coated.\n",
      "- Bake both pans in the preheated oven. Cook bacon until crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove bacon to cool on a rack. Cook potatoes until browned and tender, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven to cool.\n",
      "- Crumble bacon, reserve 1 tablespoon for garnish, and set the remaining bacon aside.\n",
      "- When potatoes are cool enough to handle, add to a large bowl. Add reserved bacon, green onions, jalapenos, pickled jalapenos, jalapeno brine, cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, and remaining ranch seasoning. Stir until well combined. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to serve. Garnish with reserved bacon, jalapenos, and green onion.\n",
